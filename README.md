Image Segmentation Using Clustering Algorithms
#
The project deals with the segmentation of color images using clustering algorithms. For this purpose, the algorithms k-means and DBSCAN are implemented. The objects that are clustered are the pixels of a given image named "giraffe.png". Each pixel is represented by its vector in the RGB color space (3-dimensional vector). The output of the progam provides image with its pixelsâ€™ colors replaced by the respective cluster colors.
